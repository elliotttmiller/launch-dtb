# SiteGround launch overlay

`launch/live/` is the assembled deployment overlay for `https://elliottm4.sg-host.com`. It is ignored by Git, rebuilt from canonical source paths, and is not an independent source tree or complete server backup.

## Ownership

- `frontend/` is the canonical React source. A production build is copied to `launch/live/`.
- `drywalltoolbox/.htaccess` is the canonical public-root router and is copied to `launch/live/.htaccess`.
- `drywalltoolbox/wp/.htaccess` and `drywalltoolbox/wp/index.php` are copied to `launch/live/wp/`.
- `drywalltoolbox/wp/wp-content/mu-plugins/` and `themes/` are canonical backend source and are copied into the matching `launch/live/wp/wp-content/` paths.
- WordPress core, regular plugins, uploads, caches, logs, `sgs_encrypt_key.php`, and `wp-config.php` are runtime-owned. They are intentionally excluded from source control and normal deployment payloads.

## Domain contract

The SiteGround installation uses:

```text
WP_HOME    = https://elliottm4.sg-host.com
WP_SITEURL = https://elliottm4.sg-host.com/wp
```

The public document root serves the React application. Root aliases route `/wp-json/`, `/wp-admin/`, `/wp-login.php`, `/checkout/`, WooCommerce callbacks, and order-payment endpoints into the physical `/wp` WordPress installation before the SPA fallback.

The temporary SiteGround host remains non-indexable until payment and launch acceptance are complete. Do not enable search indexing merely because the frontend build succeeds.

## Assembly

From the repository root:

```powershell
./launch/scripts/assemble-siteground.ps1
```

The assembly script installs dependencies, lints and builds the frontend, then reconstructs `launch/live/` from `dist/` and the bounded `drywalltoolbox/` deployment mirror. Use `-SkipInstall` or `-SkipBuild` only when the corresponding dependency/build output is already current. Do not copy server secrets or runtime-owned WordPress trees into a deployment artifact.

Do not upload `dist-staging/` to `public_html/`. The staging build is compiled for `/staging/2972/` and will produce 404s for root-deployed assets such as `/staging/2972/assets/js/main.js`.

## GitHub Actions deployment

The production release is `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` (`Controlled SiteGround Release`). It is manual-only and deploys over SFTP. It does not use `launch/wp/.git`; that nested repository is a local/runtime WordPress snapshot and is intentionally excluded from the outer repository.

Configure the GitHub environment named `siteground-production` with a required reviewer and these environment secrets:

```text
SITEGROUND_SFTP_HOST
SITEGROUND_SFTP_PORT
SITEGROUND_SFTP_USERNAME
SITEGROUND_SFTP_PASSWORD
SITEGROUND_REMOTE_DIR
```

Copy the SFTP host, port, username, and password from SiteGround Site Tools. Set `SITEGROUND_REMOTE_DIR` to the exact remote directory that File Manager identifies as the document root for `elliottm4.sg-host.com`; do not guess this value and do not paste credentials into repository files or support messages.

Before the first production release, run `CI Build Validation - No Deploy` from `main`. After it passes, run `Controlled SiteGround Release`, choose `deploy`, enter `DEPLOY`, and approve the protected environment. The workflow builds an immutable payload, backs up exactly the managed file surface, uploads only that surface, performs HTTP smoke checks, and automatically restores the file backup if deployment or smoke checks fail. Database and external-service rollback remain operator-owned.

For an explicit file restore, rerun `Controlled SiteGround Release` with `restore`, enter `RESTORE`, and provide the original workflow run ID and exact `siteground-backup-*` artifact name.

## Required runtime actions

Code cannot safely perform these host/database/payment actions:

1. Back up the SiteGround files and database.
2. Set WordPress `home` to `https://elliottm4.sg-host.com` and `siteurl` to `https://elliottm4.sg-host.com/wp`; verify with `wp option get home` and `wp option get siteurl`. In the runtime-owned `/wp/wp-config.php`, before WordPress loads, define the matching root REST/auth-cookie topology:

   ```php
   define( 'WP_HOME', 'https://elliottm4.sg-host.com' );
   define( 'WP_SITEURL', 'https://elliottm4.sg-host.com/wp' );
   define( 'COOKIEPATH', '/' );
   define( 'SITECOOKIEPATH', '/' );
   define( 'ADMIN_COOKIE_PATH', '/' );
   define( 'DTB_ENABLE_WOO_ADMIN_REST_NONCE_COMPAT', true );
   define( 'DTB_ENABLE_ROOT_AUTH_COOKIE_MIGRATION', true );
   ```

   The nonce compatibility flag restores only verified same-site, cookie-authenticated admin reads after an expired `wp_rest` nonce. Its only allowed non-GET request is WooCommerce's read-only payment-provider discovery action; payment-setting mutations remain protected. The root-cookie migration flag reissues the current valid WordPress session token once at `/` when wp-admin is still running from an older `/wp` cookie. After changing cookie paths, clear SiteGround caches, remove existing browser cookies for the host, and sign in again.
3. Dry-run a serialized-data-aware old-origin replacement, then apply only after reviewing counts:

   ```text
   wp search-replace 'https://drywalltoolbox.com' 'https://elliottm4.sg-host.com' --all-tables-with-prefix --precise --dry-run
   ```

4. Activate the `headless-base` theme and verify the complete DTB MU-plugin composition root.
5. Keep SiteGround Speed Optimizer active. DTB uses its public `sg_cachepress_purge_cache()` contract; SiteGround CDN purge remains a Site Tools operation.
6. Configure the official WooCommerce Stripe Payment Gateway for the SiteGround domain, connect the Stripe account, enable the approved payment methods, register/verify webhooks, and verify Apple Pay domain association if eligible. DTB never stores those credentials.
7. Run session-preserving cart, authentication, checkout, payment, webhook replay, order-once, refund, Veeqo, and QuickBooks acceptance checks before removing the launch gate or enabling indexing.

## Current verified runtime gap

On 2026-07-21, the public root served the coming-soon document while root `/wp-json/`, `/checkout/`, and `/wp-admin/` returned 404. WordPress responded only through `/wp/?rest_route=/`. The official Stripe extension was present but its gateway was disabled, the Stripe account was not connected, and webhook readiness was unknown. A local build or file upload must not be represented as launch readiness until these runtime checks pass.
