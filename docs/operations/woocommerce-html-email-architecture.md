# WooCommerce classic HTML email architecture

Last reconciled with tracked source: 2026-08-15.

Scope: WooCommerce's classic HTML/PHP transactional email pipeline only.
Plain-text templates, the block email editor, and POS templates are
explicitly out of scope and are never touched by any file described here.

## Ownership model

- **`dtb-platform`** owns the shared branded email presentation system,
  reusable components, platform-wide sender identity, and the transactional
  Reply-To alignment safeguard (`Support/Email.php`,
  `Support/Email/Deliverability.php`, and
  `Support/Email/OrderItemPresentation.php`). SMTP transport and DNS-based
  authentication (SPF/DKIM/DMARC/PTR) remain infrastructure concerns and are
  not encoded in application code.
- **`dtb-commerce`** owns WooCommerce email registration, template
  resolution, settings integration, and commerce-specific content
  (`Email/TemplateOverride.php` and `Email/templates/emails/*.php`).
- **`dtb-order-platform`** owns order-event identity and duplicate prevention
  for customer-facing order emails.
- **`dtb-integrations`** remains authoritative for Veeqo fulfillment and
  tracking projections.

## Template-routing strategy

`dtb-commerce/Email/TemplateOverride.php` hooks `woocommerce_locate_template`
at a late priority with an explicit allowlist. It only rewrites WooCommerce's
resolved template path when WooCommerce resolved its own bundled default, the
template is allowlisted, and the request is not for `emails/plain/*`.

## Gmail/client rendering contract

The classic HTML shell uses a conservative table-first structure capped at
680px. The outer shell is centered by table alignment, not by a spacer-column
layout or CSS-only sizing. The shell table itself is `width="100%"` with a
680px maximum so a narrow client remains intrinsically fluid even if its
media-query processing is incomplete. Critical dimensions, backgrounds,
padding, and logo sizing are duplicated inline so Gmail variants still render
the intended structure after sanitization/inlining.

Shared content rails (introduction, lifecycle progress, section cards) use a
percentage width in the base rules. Critical layout must not depend on
`calc()`, flexbox, grid, viewport units, JavaScript, or client-side DOM
behavior. The mobile media query is therefore a progressive enhancement for
spacing, typography, address stacking, and compact order-item sizing—not the
mechanism that prevents horizontal overflow.

Remote web fonts are not required for layout correctness. The email shell
must remain readable with native sans-serif fallbacks when clients strip
`<link>` tags or external font requests.

### Decorative hero artwork

The desktop lifecycle hero may use the approved background artwork as a
progressive decorative treatment. The artwork is never semantic content. On
clients at 600px and below, DTB explicitly disables the hero background image
and renders a deterministic solid `#030712` hero. This avoids Gmail mobile
scaling the legacy HTML `background` attribute independently from the CSS
`background-size` declaration, which previously allowed the decorative image
to dominate the message viewport. The order/lifecycle eyebrow and `h1` remain
ordinary live text.

### Mobile order and address behavior

The order summary remains one semantic table. On narrow clients the header row
is hidden, while product identity remains the flexible column and quantity and
price remain bounded columns. Product images are reduced to 50px. This avoids
maintaining duplicate desktop/mobile order markup.

Billing and shipping addresses use a fixed two-column table at desktop width
and stack through the single mobile media query. Address, email, shipping, SKU,
and metadata text are allowed to wrap so long values cannot force horizontal
overflow.

## Sender identity and Reply-To contract

`dtb-platform/Support/Email.php` defines the canonical outbound From identity.
`dtb-platform/Support/Email/Deliverability.php` normalizes Reply-To headers at
the `wp_mail` boundary. Same-domain Reply-To values are preserved; missing or
cross-domain Reply-To values are replaced with the canonical DTB mailbox.
This prevents a legitimate DTB message from intentionally presenting a
Drywall Toolbox From address while routing replies to an unrelated domain.

The application does **not** configure SMTP credentials, DKIM keys, SPF,
DMARC, return-path/envelope sender, PTR/rDNS, or TLS. Those remain provider and
DNS configuration. Production deployment therefore requires the configured
SMTP provider to authenticate the same organizational domain used by the
visible From header.

## Settings precedence

WooCommerce Settings → Emails remains authoritative for enablement,
recipients, CC/BCC, email type, and any subject/heading/additional-content an
administrator has explicitly configured. DTB supplies default copy and visual
presentation without bypassing WooCommerce's email settings system.

## Fulfillment authority

Veeqo remains authoritative for shipment/tracking facts. Native WooCommerce
Fulfillment objects and their notification hooks continue to own fulfillment
email triggering. The email rendering and deliverability changes do not alter
order creation, payment, inventory, fulfillment, queues, or provider state.

## Validation and production checks

Before shipping email changes to production:

- render at least admin new-order and customer processing-order emails through
  WooCommerce, not a standalone HTML fixture;
- verify desktop Gmail web and Gmail mobile/app rendering at narrow and wide
  widths;
- confirm the mobile hero renders as a solid dark surface with live text and
  no oversized decorative background artwork;
- verify the order table, totals, billing/shipping addresses, progress steps,
  CTAs, and long SKU/shipping text without horizontal overflow at narrow
  widths;
- inspect the received message's original headers and confirm SPF, DKIM, and
  DMARC pass with an aligned `From: ...@drywalltoolbox.com` identity;
- confirm Reply-To is a `@drywalltoolbox.com` mailbox;
- confirm public HTTPS availability of `/logos/email-logo-white.png` and any
  email icon assets used by the rendered template;
- verify SMTP transport/TLS and provider-level envelope sender settings in the
  production mailer configuration.
