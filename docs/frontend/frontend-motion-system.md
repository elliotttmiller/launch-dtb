# Frontend Motion and Render Continuity System

## Ownership

`frontend/` owns storefront presentation motion, route rendering continuity, client-side code preloading, local loading presentation, accessibility, and responsive behavior. These concerns must never become authorities for commerce state, payment state, inventory, orders, checkout persistence, routing data, or provider behavior.

The motion system has two canonical timing authorities:

- `frontend/src/motion/dtbMotion.js` — Framer Motion transitions, variants, restrained spring physics, distances, durations, and reduced-motion variants.
- `frontend/src/styles/storefront-tokens.css` — numerically matching CSS duration/easing/distance tokens.

`frontend/src/styles/storefront-motion.css` is the shared CSS timing layer. Feature styles continue to own geometry, appearance, layout, and component-specific states.

`frontend/src/components/motion/GlobalMotionProvider.jsx` applies the application-wide Framer Motion default and `reducedMotion="user"`. `App.jsx` mounts the single application `LazyMotion` boundary with `strict` enabled so feature code must continue using the lightweight `m` components and cannot silently bypass the async animation-engine contract.

## Render-continuity contract

Route loading is not page animation. Data loading is not route loading. Image loading is not page loading.

The customer-facing contract is:

1. Persistent content stays persistent.
2. Destination geometry appears immediately when a lazy route is unresolved.
3. Only unresolved regions display loading treatment after the route module is available.
4. Page roots never animate from `opacity: 0`.
5. Likely route code is requested from navigation intent before the click completes.
6. Motion confirms a state transition; it must not conceal application latency.
7. Loading indicators must preserve the geometry of the state they replace instead of introducing an unrelated full-page surface.

The persistent header, footer, cart shell, navigation surfaces, and other application chrome remain mounted during normal route navigation.

## Route-module loading

`frontend/src/routing/routeModules.js` is the route-module loading authority. It owns:

- the mapping from application route groups to dynamic page imports;
- promise de-duplication so preload and render consume the same module request;
- route-path resolution for preload intent;
- the existing one-time chunk-load recovery behavior.

Do not define a second independent dynamic import for a route that already exists in this registry. A preload that downloads different code than the corresponding `React.lazy` boundary defeats the continuity contract.

`frontend/src/components/routing/RouteIntentPreloader.jsx` observes same-origin internal links and preloads recognized route modules on pointer intent, keyboard focus, and touch intent. Imperative navigation surfaces that are not anchors should call `preloadRoute()` before navigation when practical. Product cards do this explicitly for PDP navigation.

Preloading is an optimization only. Routing correctness must never depend on a successful preload.

## Lazy-route pending surfaces

The application-level `Suspense` boundary uses `RouteLoadingSurface`, not a centered route spinner.

The pending surface is intentionally static and geometry-oriented:

- catalog routes reserve heading and product-grid geometry;
- product routes reserve gallery and purchase-panel geometry;
- account/content routes reserve stable content-panel geometry.

These surfaces do not attempt to reproduce business data and do not own loading state after the route module has rendered. Route components remain responsible for their own data skeletons and unresolved regions.

Protected routes use the same pending-surface language while authentication is validating. Authentication and redirect behavior remain unchanged.

## Initial document handoff

`frontend/index.html` owns a minimal static boot surface that can paint before the React entry bundle executes. It is presentation-only and contains no commerce, authentication, routing, or data authority.

`frontend/src/main.jsx` owns the handoff. `AppBootMarker` waits for React to commit and for two `requestAnimationFrame` boundaries before setting `data-dtb-app-mounted="true"`. The static shell then performs only a short opacity release and is removed from the document.

The boot surface must remain visually quiet: stable application background, DTB branding, no full-screen progress animation, no artificial minimum display duration. Under `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce`, its transition is effectively immediate.

Checkout retains its dedicated document-level handoff. `dtb-checkout-route-booting` suppresses the ordinary application boot surface so the two loaders never compete.

The boot watchdog remains the failure authority when the entry bundle does not mount. Before showing its recovery UI it removes the static boot shell, ensuring a failed boot cannot leave the recovery action obscured.

## History scroll restoration

`ScrollToTop` remains the sole route viewport authority. It sets native `history.scrollRestoration` to `manual` while the SPA is mounted and stores window scroll positions by React Router history `location.key`.

Navigation semantics are:

- `PUSH` / ordinary route change: reset to the new route start before paint.
- `POP` / browser Back or Forward: restore the previously recorded position for that history entry when available.
- query-only changes on the same pathname/hash: preserve the current viewport because those query parameters represent in-page state such as filters and tabs.
- hash navigation without a saved POP position: resolve the hash target before falling back to the route start.

Saved positions are session-memory UI state only and are bounded to 100 entries. They are not persisted, sent to the backend, or treated as application data.

## Application-shell boundary

`GlobalMotionProvider` is mounted in `frontend/src/main.jsx` above `App`, routing, header, footer, cart/sidebar surfaces, route content, dialogs, drawers, and other application UI.

`PageTransition` animates only the changing route surface. Its route variant must remain fully opaque from the first frame. Mobile/tablet retain the restrained 4 px / 180 ms settle. Desktop route commits are intentionally static and consume the reduced/static route variant because translating a full desktop page promotes a very large raster surface and can destabilize sticky/fixed descendants. Do not restore whole-page desktop transforms or entire-page fades.

Checkout is excluded from the normal route wrapper because payment-provider rendering and checkout integrity take precedence over decorative page motion. Provider-owned payment controls must never be wrapped in transforms or transitions that could interfere with focus, authentication, or payment behavior.

## Motion language

DTB uses one restrained motion language across desktop, tablet, and mobile:

1. **Route settle** — opaque 4 px micro-lift, 180 ms.
2. **Async replacement** — structural skeleton/content crossfade, 220 ms.
3. **Standard content reveal** — 320 ms, only for genuinely new in-page content where a reveal communicates state.
4. **Elevated reveal** — 360–400 ms for deliberate overlays or major presentation changes.
5. **Direct manipulation** — low-bounce spring for drawers, indicators, toggles, and controls whose geometry follows user interaction.
6. **Exit/dismissal** — 180 ms.

A component must not replay a second root entrance animation immediately after `PageTransition`. Local animations are appropriate for dialogs, accordions, transient messages, cart-line insertion/removal, image-gallery changes, and similar stateful regions.

## Canonical motion values

### Timed easing

- Standard: `cubic-bezier(0.22, 1, 0.36, 1)`
- Emphasized: `cubic-bezier(0.16, 1, 0.3, 1)`
- Soft: `cubic-bezier(0.2, 0.8, 0.2, 1)`
- Exit: `cubic-bezier(0.4, 0, 0.2, 1)`

### Durations

- Instant: 100 ms
- Fast/route settle: 180 ms
- Async replacement: 220 ms
- Normal: 320 ms
- Elevated: 360 ms
- Overlay: 400 ms
- Slow: 440 ms

The 440 ms token remains available for rare intentionally slow presentation work. It is not the loading-replacement duration.

### Physical response

Default interactive spring:

- stiffness: 360
- damping: 34
- mass: 0.82

Gentler sheet/drawer spring:

- stiffness: 300
- damping: 32
- mass: 0.9

Springs do not receive CSS easing functions.

## Loading hierarchy

Use the narrowest valid loading boundary:

- **Route module unresolved:** `RouteLoadingSurface`.
- **Authentication unresolved:** the protected-route pending surface.
- **Page data unresolved:** a skeleton local to that page region.
- **Image unresolved:** image placeholder/skeleton inside its existing media geometry.
- **Mutation pending:** preserve existing content and disable/annotate the affected control; do not replace the complete page.
- **Document navigation/checkout handoff:** keep the current document visible until the browser commits the destination unless the dedicated checkout flow owns a different safe handoff.

Avoid sequential replacement chains such as route spinner → page spinner → skeleton → content.

## Desktop stability contract

Desktop has a larger composited paint surface than mobile and therefore uses stricter large-surface rules:

- Do not apply a transform or persistent `will-change` to the complete desktop route tree.
- Desktop mega-menu taxonomy switching is atomic. The open sheet remains painted while its rendered panel changes; there is no fade-to-zero or multi-frame blank interval between menu tabs.
- The desktop mega-menu keeps a constant centering transform and may animate opacity only. Do not scale or vertically translate the full 1000–1240 px fixed sheet during routine open/close.
- Desktop navigation must use explicit transitioned properties. `transition: all` is prohibited on primary navigation controls.
- Product-card `content-visibility: auto` is restricted to viewports at or below 1024 px. Desktop product grids remain continuously painted to avoid visibility-heuristic pop-in during hover and scrolling.
- Local transforms remain appropriate for small controls, chevrons, buttons, and bounded cards when they do not force a large subtree into its own compositor layer.

These constraints prioritize frame continuity over decorative movement. A stable desktop frame is the primary requirement.

## Product Quick View continuity

Desktop Quick View is a large overlay surface and follows stricter lifecycle rules than small dialogs:

- The desktop Quick View panel is opacity-only. Do not scale or vertically translate the viewport-sized modal scroll shell.
- The modal shell must not use persistent `will-change`, `translateZ(0)`, or `contain: layout paint` as blanket compositor hints.
- Full-screen backdrop blur is prohibited for routine Quick View open/close; use a stable translucent backdrop instead.
- Body scroll locking must compensate for the removed scrollbar and preserve that lock until the exit animation has completed. Restoring overflow before exit completion causes the storefront to shift underneath a still-visible modal.
- Quick View shell geometry CSS must live in a persistent imported stylesheet, not a conditional `<style>` node inside the presence subtree.
- Product data must remain mounted through the exit interval. Owners set visibility false first and clear the selected product only after the 180 ms exit has completed.
- `ProductModal` is the sole document scroll-lock owner for Quick View. `ProductDetail` and nested PDP children must never write `body.style.overflow`, `body.style.paddingRight`, or equivalent document geometry.
- Desktop product-card intent prewarms both the Quick View component modules and the canonical `/catalog/products/:slug/detail` request through the same in-flight/cache authority consumed by the modal.
- `product-quick-view-desktop.css` is the sole Quick View geometry authority. General PDP polish styles must not redeclare `.product-modal-card-shell` geometry.
- Nested Quick View owners such as search and cart must restore the prior scroll-lock state rather than assuming the body was originally unlocked.
- Product imagery may animate locally inside its bounded gallery; those image transitions must not promote or transform the complete modal shell.

These rules apply to catalog, homepage/product rails, search, and cart Quick View entry points.

## Responsive contract

Motion semantics are shared across breakpoints. Mobile differences are limited to interaction geometry where the interaction itself differs.

Mobile navigation and drawers use the shared low-bounce spring. The outer mobile-drawer shell is structural only; the Motion backdrop and drawer own entrance/exit animation so CSS does not double-animate the same surface.

Pending route geometry collapses responsively while retaining the destination's general visual structure.

## Accessibility

`GlobalMotionProvider` uses `reducedMotion="user"`, and the CSS motion authority includes a `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce` safety net.

Reduced motion removes nonessential transforms, smooth scrolling, shimmer animation, and long CSS transitions while preserving state changes, visibility, focus, layout, and loading semantics. Static route pending geometry remains visible because it communicates application state without requiring animation.

## Performance rules

- Prefer opacity and transform for motion.
- Page roots must remain opaque.
- Do not animate page width, expensive layout properties, or large blur values for routine navigation.
- Do not apply universal transitions or `transition: all`.
- Do not stack CSS and Framer Motion transforms on the same interaction surface.
- Route transitions must not delay data fetching.
- Loading skeletons reserve final component geometry.
- Do not disable route code splitting to hide lazy-loading defects; preload likely chunks instead.
- Internal route preloading must remain same-origin and de-duplicated.
- Geometry measurement must batch reads before writes where possible to avoid forced synchronous layout.
- Persistent shell components stay mounted during route transitions.
- The static document boot shell must yield only after a committed React frame; it must never become a route-loading surface.
- Browser-history restoration must remain synchronous in the layout phase and must not add delayed corrective scroll writes.
- Keep `LazyMotion` strict; new animated components use `m` under the shared async feature provider rather than importing the full `motion` component.

## Regression contract

`frontend/tests/renderContinuityContract.test.mjs` statically protects the critical continuity rules: centralized route loading, no legacy route spinner, opaque route motion, the 220 ms async replacement token, absence of root fades on the specifically remediated cart/repair/order-tracking surfaces, history-aware POP restoration, strict LazyMotion usage, the initial HTML-to-React boot handoff, static desktop route composition, atomic desktop mega-menu switching, bounded navigation transitions, desktop product-card paint continuity, and geometry-stable Quick View open/close lifecycle.

This test supplements browser profiling; it does not prove runtime frame pacing. Lighthouse/Chrome Performance traces remain required when changing startup providers, global CSS, large navigation surfaces, or animation-heavy components.

## Implementation rules

New Framer Motion code should consume semantic transitions/variants from `dtbMotion.js`. New CSS should use `--dtb-motion-*` tokens.

When modifying bespoke motion, migrate it to the nearest semantic transition instead of adding one-off timings. Feature-specific motion is acceptable only where the interaction cannot be represented by route, async, content, surface, overlay, direct-manipulation, or exit semantics.
