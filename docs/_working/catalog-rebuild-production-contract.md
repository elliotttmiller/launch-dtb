# Working Contract: Production Catalog Rebuild

## Status

Approved for implementation planning and deterministic migration generation. The official catalog remains the active canonical launch CSV until the rebuilt output passes every gate and is deliberately promoted.

## Objective

Rebuild the complete 755-row DTB catalog into a professional production contract for WooCommerce and read-only reconciliation with the existing Veeqo catalog and kits. Preserve protected identities while correcting taxonomy, schema semantics, controlled vocabularies, relationships, media, commerce metadata, toolset composition, and deterministic generation.

Replacement Parts, Brands, Stilts, product attributes, compatibility, schematics, and fixed toolset BOMs remain separate data dimensions or domains. They do not become children merely to fit this tool-shopping tree.

### Universal cross-brand taxonomy rule

- The taxonomy registry is universal for every brand. Stable taxon keys, parent relationships, customer labels, slugs, ordering, and publication policy cannot vary by brand.
- Brand is an orthogonal attribute/facet and must never become a product-category parent, duplicate branch, or brand-specific category alias.
- Product classification is based on the product's function and exact evidence, not its manufacturer. Equivalent product types from different brands map to the same taxon key.
- A brand is not required to occupy every category. Genuine assortment gaps remain empty rather than being filled through inferred or inaccurate assignments.
- Validation must emit a brand-by-taxon coverage matrix and reject any category path containing a brand label or any assignment referring to a taxon outside the universal registry.

## Identity invariants

- Preserve every existing SKU and its case unless a separately approved protected-identity correction supplies authoritative evidence.
- Preserve parent/variation relationships and variation SKUs.
- Preserve MPN/manufacturer SKU, GTIN, brand identity, external provider identity, and exact schematic/compatibility identifiers unless explicitly approved.
- Category aliases never resolve protected identity.
- A product may have multiple applicable category paths without duplicating the product row or SKU.
- Veeqo bundle and sellable identities remain unchanged; DTB does not recreate or overwrite the already-configured kits.

## Source and projection boundaries

```text
Approved canonical catalog sources under products/
  -> deterministic catalog assembler and validators
  -> WooCommerce import CSV projection
  -> WooCommerce runtime products and variations
  -> existing Veeqo exact-SKU inventory/order mapping

Canonical fixed toolset BOM source
  -> included-items storefront projection
  -> legacy _includes_* compatibility projection
  -> read-only Veeqo kit drift comparison
```

WooCommerce owns commerce and runtime product records. Veeqo owns inventory, allocation, kit expansion, picking, and fulfillment. The rebuild must not add another runtime catalog database, PIM authority, or component-order implementation.

## Required canonical contracts

1. **Product identity and commercial rows** — simple, variable, and variation identity; parent; protected identifiers; publication state; price/cost source; commerce mode.
2. **Taxonomy manifest** — stable category ID/key, customer label, path, parent, aliases, publishability, and indexability intent.
3. **SKU-category assignment manifest** — one or more exact target paths per owner SKU with evidence and disposition.
4. **Attribute dictionary** — stable key, label, type, unit, allowed values, applicable families, variation use, filterability, and source authority.
5. **Product attribute assignments** — normalized evidence-backed values; missing is preferable to invented.
6. **Media manifest** — exact asset identity, production URL, ownership/inheritance, ordering, content-type verification, and missing-media disposition.
7. **Relationship manifest** — replacement, compatibility, parent family, schematic identity, and exact resolution method.
8. **Toolset BOM manifest** — sellable toolset SKU, component SKU, explicit quantity, display label, position, BOM version, and deterministic hash.
9. **SEO projection** — product title/description/canonical/noindex fields consumed by the existing DTB SEO pipeline.
10. **Shipping/package evidence** — weight, dimensions, shipping-class policy, and source status without inventory authority.

## Controlled-vocabulary rules

- Product types remain Woo-compatible: `simple`, `variable`, `variation`.
- Variable parents are non-order-line presentation containers; variations carry sellable identity where applicable.
- Commerce modes must have one enforced vocabulary and matching Woo purchasability behavior.
- Toolsets remain one customer-facing Woo line and one exact Veeqo kit SKU.
- Automatic/semi-automatic and set type are explicit structured properties even when category paths also expose them.
- Combined labels such as `Angle Heads & Corner Finishers` are customer presentation labels, not two product identities.

## Mutation safety

- Preview is always the default.
- Every official CSV mutation requires an exact sibling `dtb_official_catalog.csv.bak` made immediately before writing and hash-verified against the input.
- Writes must be atomic, concurrency-safe, UTF-8 BOM/CRLF preserving, and field-allowlisted.
- A second identical run must produce zero changes.
- Any missing evidence remains unresolved in a review manifest; it cannot be inferred from fuzzy similarity or competitor terminology.
- Generated artifacts never silently replace their owning source.

## Promotion gates

The rebuilt CSV cannot replace the official catalog until:

- ordered schema, row count, SKU uniqueness, and parent/variation validation pass;
- all 755 rows have an explicit migration disposition;
- taxonomy assignment is deterministic and unresolved exceptions are approved or blocked;
- customer-facing category labels and stable keys project consistently;
- no staging/local media URL remains and every production URL returns an image content type, except approved unpublished/quarantined rows;
- commerce modes and Woo purchasability agree;
- prices/costs and nonpositive margins have approved dispositions;
- toolset BOMs reconcile to existing Veeqo kits by exact sellable SKU, component SKU, and quantity;
- generated inventory bootstrap files are excluded from live synchronization;
- shipping/package gaps have approved policy dispositions;
- audit, generator, taxonomy, media, BOM, and import-shape checks pass twice idempotently;
- an independent reviewer confirms no protected-identity or unrelated-field drift.

## P0 platform gates discovered during architecture review

These must be resolved before a rebuilt import artifact can be considered production-safe:

1. **Public full-catalog export exposure** — the current `/dtb/v1/products-csv` surface can stream the full import schema, including cost and internal metadata. The production import artifact must be private/admin/deployment-only. Any public export must use an explicit sanitized allowlist and must not expose cost, internal workflow metadata, protected integration identifiers, or import controls.
2. **Unpinned importer discovery** — catalog import must consume one explicitly selected release artifact and source hash. It must not discover and schedule whichever `product-*.csv` files are newest.
3. **Import concurrency and identity** — one release/import identity, one lease, persisted result, bounded retry semantics, and reconciliation are required. The importer must not broadly unschedule unrelated work.
4. **Veeqo inventory protection** — the rebuilt Woo import must not establish independent stock truth or overwrite live Veeqo projections. Catalog stock columns require a release policy that prevents static quantity/on-hand values from becoming operational authority.
5. **Multiple category membership projection** — the target permits evidence-backed dual placement for Handles & Extensions and Tool Sets. Backend DTO/facet contracts and frontend adapters must represent an ordered, deduplicated set of memberships rather than assuming exactly one group/child membership.
6. **Taxonomy validator cardinality** — deterministic validation must accept multiple approved canonical paths for one owner product while still rejecting ambiguous, unsupported, or conflicting paths. Variations inherit the exact ordered set from their parent.

## Initial migration policy

- Taxonomy label/path changes are allowed because the user approved a rebuild, but they require a complete old-to-new manifest and redirect/canonical/sitemap analysis before live import.
- Handles and toolsets may receive automatic, semi-automatic, or dual category assignments only from exact product, compatibility, or component evidence.
- `Continuous Flow Tools` is contract-valid; empty Woo term publication remains a deployment decision.
- Tool cases and products outside the approved tree remain explicit taxonomy exceptions until assigned to an approved separate accessories/storage domain.
- Parts and stilts retain their current separate domains until their own approved taxonomy contracts are defined.
