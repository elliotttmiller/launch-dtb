# Official Launch Catalog

`dtb_official_catalog.csv` is the canonical launch catalog source under `products/`. WooCommerce owns the runtime product and variation records imported from this source.

## Authority boundaries

- The official CSV owns canonical launch product content and identifiers represented in the export.
- SKU, MPN/manufacturer SKU, GTIN, brand identity, taxonomy identity, compatibility relationships, and external IDs are protected business data.
- Veeqo remains authoritative for inventory, allocation, fulfillment, shipping, and tracking. The official catalog's `Stock` field is an opening stock import value only; after initial setup, use Veeqo as the live quantity authority.
- Pricing follows WooCommerce/runtime pricing ownership; enrichment does not create another price authority.
- Derived research, comparison, and run-report files are not canonical product truth.

## Veeqo launch product import

Build the product setup import from the canonical catalog with:

```powershell
.\scripts\catalog\rebuild-veeqo-inventory-import.ps1 -Apply
```

The generated `veeqo_inventory.csv` includes every official catalog row and SKU regardless of WooCommerce publish status or product type. Variable parents and variations retain their source titles/options, and draft rows are included. `total_qty` carries the catalog's opening quantity for simple products and variations; variable parent rows leave it blank because stock is tracked at the sellable child SKU. The current launch baseline is 10 units per simple/variation SKU, within the requested 10–100 opening range. Import this file with the correct Veeqo warehouse/location selected. After this initial stock load, Veeqo owns current quantity; do not treat the catalog or product-setup CSV as a live stock feed. Product IDs and export-only stock-value columns remain omitted.

The same build also creates `veeqo_stock_levels.csv`, a stock-only upload with Veeqo's `SKU` and `total-qty` columns. In Veeqo, choose **Inventory → Import**, select the intended location and **Stock levels only**, then map these two columns to SKU and Stock Quantity, review, and submit. This live warehouse import is a separate operator action; generating the file does not alter Veeqo.

The official WooCommerce CSV sets `Stock` to 10 and `In stock?` to `1` on each simple product and variation. WooCommerce's CSV importer uses a numeric `Stock` value to enable per-product stock management. Variable parents leave `Stock` blank and inherit availability from their managed variations. Backorders remain disabled. If the actual counted opening quantity differs from this explicitly selected launch baseline, replace the baseline with the warehouse count before importing either CSV.

WooCommerce is the retail-price authority. When a catalog row has no regular or active sale price, the Veeqo import projection writes `0.00` to `sales_price` as an explicit placeholder for later pricing work. This placeholder exists only in the generated Veeqo CSV and does not write or assert a WooCommerce catalog price. The generator reports the placeholder count and a short SKU sample; replace these values with reviewed prices before treating them as customer-facing retail prices.

WooCommerce remains the price and checkout-tax authority. The Veeqo `tax_rate` import field is populated with Minnesota's 6.875% state general sales-tax rate as a decimal (`0.06875`), from the Minnesota Department of Revenue's [Taxes and Rates guide](https://www.revenue.state.mn.us/guide/taxes-and-rates). Minnesota transaction tax can also include applicable local taxes, and the final tax calculation remains transaction/destination-specific in WooCommerce.

The Veeqo product `description` and `cost_price` are projected from the official catalog's `Description` and `Cost of goods` fields. TSW supplier evidence may populate those fields only after a unique brand-scoped identifier match or an explicit reviewed mapping; unmatched or conflicting products remain unchanged.

## One official catalog run

Use:

```powershell
.\scripts\catalog\run-official-catalog-enrichment.ps1
```

The default run is non-mutating and performs:

1. structural validation;
2. actionable enrichment audit;
3. SKU/family remediation manifest generation;
4. evidence-bounded SEO/content preparation;
5. unified run manifest generation.

Outputs are written under `products/dev/catalog-enrichment/` and ignored by Git.

For reviewed deterministic safe fixes, use the same command explicitly:

```powershell
.\scripts\catalog\run-official-catalog-enrichment.ps1 -ApplySafeFixes
```

The current safe fix clears stale explicit PDP canonical overrides so the React storefront can own `/products/:slug`. The run records the mutation and validates the catalog afterward.

## Actionable audit policy

The remediation CSV is deliberately narrower than raw completeness metrics.

It creates work for:

- missing item-level MPNs;
- missing customer-facing media;
- classification/taxonomy inconsistencies on rows that own classification;
- compatibility/replacement research at the simple-part or variable-part-family level.

It does not create default remediation work merely because:

- a variable family parent has no MPN while its variations own item identifiers;
- GTIN is absent and no authoritative requirement/source is established;
- a variation inherits category/display-category from its parent;
- a child part variation can inherit or refine compatibility after its family is researched.

GTIN is retained as an informational coverage metric.

## Structural contract

The canonical schema is owned by `scripts/catalog/official_catalog_schema.py` and executed by `scripts/catalog/validate_official_catalog.py`.

It validates the ordered schema, SKU uniqueness, synchronized brand fields, manufacturer identifiers, structured-spec JSON shape, variation/parent integrity, default variations, and reviewed include-name gaps.

## Enrichment rules

Use this sequence:

1. **Clean** demonstrated errors and duplicate/inconsistent representations.
2. **Normalize** deterministic values and controlled vocabularies.
3. **Identify actionable gaps** against actual B2C storefront/catalog requirements.
4. **Acquire evidence** only for those gaps.
5. **Validate** identity, relationships, units, taxonomy, and cross-field consistency.
6. **Write back** only evidence-backed facts to the canonical catalog.
7. **Rerun** the unified catalog pipeline.

A missing value is preferable to an invented product fact. Fuzzy matching, OCR, extraction, competitor data, and generated text can produce candidates but cannot silently rewrite protected identifiers or compatibility.

## Structured specifications

`Meta: _dtb_specs_json` is the canonical customer-facing structured-spec payload. It is a JSON array; each entry requires a non-empty `label` and either a non-empty `value` or non-empty `items` array.

Do not duplicate equivalent attributes merely to increase completeness.

## Product-specific changes

Every row-level enrichment must be attributable to product-specific evidence. Methodology articles and enrichment research define process; they do not establish a DTB SKU's factual value.
