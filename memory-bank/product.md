Last verified against active source: 2026-07-21.

## Product definition

Drywall Toolbox is a contractor-focused headless commerce and service-operations platform for professional drywall tools, replacement parts, schematics, and repair/service workflows. The current launch host is `elliottm4.sg-host.com`; the legacy production origin remains only as migration input and for existing email identities.

It combines:

- multi-brand ecommerce backed by WooCommerce products, Store API cart/session state, native WooCommerce Checkout Block, and the official WooCommerce Stripe Payment Gateway;
- Veeqo-backed inventory/fulfillment authority and QuickBooks accounting projection;
- schematic-driven part discovery, compatibility, and universal-part intelligence;
- repair intake, quoting, lifecycle tracking, media, SLA, and operator workflows;
- returns and support-ticket workflows with customer-facing status views;
- customer account, address, order-history, tracking, and preference experiences;
- calculator/estimation tools with a structured browser print/Save-as-PDF report workflow;
- catalog, taxonomy, pricing, image, schematic, source-data, and operational tooling in the same repository.

The public browsing/account/cart experience is the React SPA in `frontend/`. WordPress/WooCommerce under `drywalltoolbox/wp/` is the commerce and operational backend.

WooCommerce owns storefront checkout/order creation and the operational order/payment/refund record. The official WooCommerce Stripe Payment Gateway owns embedded payment rendering, supported Stripe methods, eligible wallets/Link, tokenization, 3DS/SCA, payment execution, and webhook synchronization. DTB observes verified Woo lifecycle events and owns domain policy, write boundaries, queues, projections, integrations, and operator workflows. Veeqo is the inventory/fulfillment authority. QuickBooks is an accounting projection target.

## Primary users

### External

- professional drywall contractors and crews;
- buyers ordering tools, parts, accessories, and tool sets;
- customers using schematics to identify replacement parts;
- customers submitting and tracking repairs, returns, and support requests;
- customers reviewing order, shipment, repair, return, and support status;
- contractors using estimation calculators and printable/PDF reports.

### Internal

- operators managing orders, repairs, returns, support, and exceptions through wp-admin workbenches;
- catalog operators maintaining taxonomy, product metadata, pricing, images, compatibility, and schematics;
- administrators managing platform health, the official Stripe gateway, Veeqo, QuickBooks, marketplace channels, routing, and deployment operations.

## Live capability map

### Storefront and product discovery

- catalog browsing, search, brand/category selection, and product detail/variation selection;
- dedicated parts and schematic discovery flows;
- Store API-backed cart with same-origin WooCommerce session continuity;
- account-aware UI, cart drawer/page, product purchase feedback, and order tracking surfaces;
- staging-aware storefront routing support without moving checkout authority into React.

### Native WooCommerce checkout

The active checkout is not a React payment form.

Current path:

```text
React cart / cart drawer
  -> WooCommerce Store API cookie-backed cart session + Nonce
  -> optional low-priority prewarm of DTB static checkout assets
  -> full-document /checkout/
  -> WordPress/WooCommerce Checkout Block
  -> official WooCommerce Stripe Payment Gateway
  -> WooCommerce order/payment lifecycle
  -> DTB captured-payment observation/event ledger
  -> dtb-orders queue
  -> Veeqo / QuickBooks / notifications / tracking
```

Current product behavior includes:

- `/checkout` React compatibility routing that immediately performs full-document navigation to native Woo checkout and guards against rewrite loops;
- root routing that sends checkout/order-pay/order-received/payment callback surfaces to WordPress before SPA fallback;
- WooCommerce Checkout Block as the only storefront order-creation surface;
- official WooCommerce Stripe embedded card/payment methods, Link, eligible express wallets, tokenization, and webhook reconciliation;
- DTB checkout presentation/readiness integration without creating a second payment authority;
- checkout-order tagging, verified paid-reference mirroring, captured-payment gating, and downstream queue dispatch;
- customer order confirmation/tracking return flows after successful checkout;
- canonical root checkout even when the shopper originated from a staging storefront path.

### Mobile checkout payment sheet

DTB now provides a mobile bottom-sheet presentation around the existing native Woo/official-Stripe checkout payment surface.

This is presentation state only. It may provide:

- accessible dialog chrome and focus containment;
- mobile viewport/keyboard handling;
- a read-only total projection from Woo Blocks `wc/store/cart` state;
- supported mobile `Pay now` presentation for the authoritative Woo Place Order action;
- non-secret readiness diagnostics.

It does not create PaymentIntents, Checkout Sessions, card fields, wallet buttons, or a second order/payment submission path. Provider-owned controls remain mounted and Stripe/WooCommerce retain payment/order authority.

### Checkout performance and resilience

The native checkout has a dedicated performance/stability layer that:

- prewarms only allowlisted DTB static checkout assets after successful cart engagement;
- restores useful Stripe resource hints on native checkout;
- suppresses only known non-essential marketing/tracking assets by explicit policy;
- applies below-fold order-summary image loading policy;
- records bounded checkout runtime diagnostics for JS/resource failures, payment-surface timeout, unexpected checkout-root replacement, layout/performance signals, and third-party budget warnings;
- provides recovery presentation if the official payment surface does not become available within the bounded timeout.

Performance behavior is fail-open. It never prefetches/caches private `/checkout/` HTML, reconstructs authoritative form state, or creates fallback payment objects.

Diagnostics endpoint:

```text
POST /wp-json/dtb/v1/checkout/runtime-telemetry
```

The route is diagnostics-only and protected by a dedicated nonce, same-origin validation when applicable, rate limiting, deduplication, bounded fields, allowlisted event kinds, and sensitive-value redaction.

### Shipping, inventory, and fulfillment

- checkout shipping options are calculated by Woo/DTB policy from configured destination/product/subtotal/weight rules;
- this is not a live Veeqo carrier-rating API;
- Veeqo remains authoritative for sellable inventory, warehouse availability, allocation, labels, fulfillment, shipment state, carrier, and tracking;
- DTB projects verified order lifecycle events into Veeqo asynchronously after the captured-payment contract passes.

### Orders, payment lifecycle, and refunds

DTB order handling includes:

- append-only lifecycle events;
- integration-state persistence;
- `dtb-orders` Action Scheduler jobs;
- order write boundary and duplicate containment;
- atomic initial downstream-dispatch barrier;
- verified official-Stripe paid-reference mirroring;
- customer/operator tracking projections;
- refund projection keyed by concrete WooCommerce `refund_id`.

Refunds are post-payment lifecycle events. Partial refund A and partial refund B are distinct accounting/operational events and must not be collapsed into one cumulative parent-order marker.

### Parts and schematics

- schematic browser and part lookup;
- product/variation/SKU resolution;
- compatible/universal-part projections;
- runtime schematic media and operator mapping/editor tooling;
- stable schematic/part/image relationships treated as business-critical data.

### Repairs

- repair-service overview and package selection;
- intake, media upload, and tracking;
- quote generation and accept/decline actions;
- lifecycle event stream, SLA, notification, queue, and operator workbench behavior in `dtb-repair-service`.

### Returns and support

- return portal and return-status pages;
- support/contact intake and ticket-status pages;
- authenticated histories and customer status views;
- backend lifecycle ownership in `dtb-returns` and `dtb-support`.

### Account and authentication

- login, registration, logout, forgot/reset-password flows;
- tabbed account/dashboard surfaces for orders, repairs, addresses, and settings;
- preferred HttpOnly `dtb_auth` cookie with optional in-memory bearer-token compatibility;
- application-wide `auth:expired` behavior after confirmed authentication failure;
- server-side customer ownership checks for protected records.

### Rewards

Rewards remain launch-gated.

Historical UI/configuration references still exist, and CI currently defines `REACT_APP_REWARDS_ENABLED=1`, but `frontend/src/utils/featureFlags.js` explicitly returns `false` for rewards and documents the initial-production disablement. Treat active source as authoritative: rewards are disabled until the complete backend contract is intentionally restored and validated.

### Calculators and report export

The Calculator Hub provides customer estimation workflows and a structured report/export experience.

Canonical report presentation lives under:

```text
frontend/src/components/calculators/report/
```

Current report contract:

- `calculatorReportModel.js` is the canonical presentation mapper from calculator summary state into the report model;
- summary and printable report consume the same model instead of maintaining separate calculations;
- report rendering formats calculator outputs but does not recalculate quantities;
- project/report state remains compatible with `dwCalc_state`;
- **Export / Save PDF** opens a dedicated report preview;
- **Save / Print PDF** uses browser print/Save-as-PDF with a print-isolated report root;
- report data is not sent to WordPress or an external PDF service.

The earlier `calc-pdf/files/` reference implementation has been removed from active source and must not be treated as architecture authority.

### Content and launch-gated tools

- FAQ, shipping policy, return policy, store policies, contact, and technical-specification preview surfaces;
- public toolset-builder route remains disabled/commented out until launch criteria are explicitly met.

## Backend product responsibilities

The WordPress layer is a headless product backend and operator cockpit, not the public React storefront renderer.

It owns:

- custom REST APIs and Store API extension behavior;
- authentication, authorization, origin policy, rate limiting, health, and diagnostics;
- catalog read models, variation normalization, product relationships, compatibility, and inventory intelligence;
- native checkout routing/runtime exceptions for the headless theme;
- official-Stripe readiness metadata and checkout presentation/performance support that does not own payment state;
- Woo checkout order tagging, event ledger, queue, write boundary, duplicate containment, refund identity, and tracking projections;
- repair, return, and support persistence/lifecycle policy;
- media/schematic administration;
- Veeqo, QuickBooks, notification, and marketplace integrations;
- wp-admin command-center/system-manager/domain workbench surfaces.

## Operational product reality

This repository is both:

1. production application source for the launch host `elliottm4.sg-host.com`; and
2. a controlled operations workspace for catalog/media/source-data lifecycle management.

`products/` and `scripts/` are core product infrastructure, not disposable support folders.

Business-critical identifiers include SKUs, part numbers, variation relationships, brands, taxonomy slugs, external IDs, image mappings, schematic paths, compatibility mappings, and source provenance.

Operational data paths have evolved. Current code/scripts must be inspected before bulk work rather than assuming historical `products/Production/launch/*` locations.

## Scope and authority boundaries

- React owns customer-facing browsing, cart shell, account UX, service intake, calculator UI/report presentation, and checkout handoff state.
- WordPress/WooCommerce owns native checkout/order creation and operational commerce persistence.
- Mu-plugin modules are the canonical home for backend business logic.
- The official WooCommerce Stripe Payment Gateway owns storefront payment-method rendering and payment execution.
- DTB mobile payment-sheet/performance layers are presentation/diagnostics only and cannot become payment authorities.
- WooCommerce owns products, customers, Store API cart/session, orders, and refunds.
- DTB owns domain policy, verified lifecycle observation, eventing, projections, queues, checkout routing support, services, and integration policy.
- Veeqo owns inventory and fulfillment truth.
- QuickBooks owns accounting projection after qualifying payment/refund events.
- Browser code never receives WooCommerce admin credentials, application passwords, consumer secrets, Stripe secret/webhook keys, PaymentIntent client secrets, wallet tokens, or integration API keys.
- Controlled catalog taxonomy is validated operationally before production import.

## Non-goals

- returning catalog/account browsing to a classic WordPress theme-first storefront;
- building a second React checkout/payment authority;
- copying/mounting private payment-plugin React/build internals inside the SPA;
- custom DTB Stripe Checkout Sessions or PaymentIntents for storefront checkout while the official WooCommerce Stripe gateway is authoritative;
- fake or independently orchestrated Apple Pay/Google Pay/Link UI;
- caching/prefetching session-owned checkout HTML for performance;
- reconstructing Woo checkout form/payment state from duplicate browser state;
- building a separate admin SPA when wp-admin workbenches own operations;
- treating catalog/media/source-data maintenance as unrelated to application engineering;
- allowing multiple systems to create or mutate the same order without a write-boundary/idempotency contract.

## Current delivery reality

CI builds/lints the frontend, validates custom PHP syntax and active domain wiring, assembles a bounded deployment payload, and rejects forbidden runtime paths.

Merge is not deployment.

The production release model is a controlled SiteGround file deployment with exact confirmation, protected approval, immutable payload, managed-surface backup, HTTP smoke validation, automatic managed-file rollback, and explicit restore. It intentionally excludes database and runtime-owned WordPress backup/restore. A successful workflow is not proof of Stripe, webhook, Veeqo, QuickBooks, or end-to-end shopper-session acceptance.

## One-line truth statement

Drywall Toolbox is a headless React + WordPress/WooCommerce contractor platform unifying ecommerce, schematic-driven parts, repairs, returns, support, calculators, and operator workflows, with WooCommerce Checkout Block plus the official WooCommerce Stripe gateway as the single storefront checkout/payment authority, DTB-controlled lifecycle observation/queues/projections, Veeqo-controlled inventory/fulfillment, QuickBooks accounting projection, and first-class catalog/media/source-data operations.
